Hi Tony,

As per your request you want to save the payment entries to an ASCII file.
Could you please send me an ASCII file that contains all the information for
just two AP entries.  This will let the estimation for this entry accurate
enough.

Please let me know what we should do with the following points:
1- Do we need to give a facility to the user to enter the ASCII file name
and its path each time while printing the BACK PAYMENT?
2- Do we need to overwrite the ASCII file each time while printing the BACK
PAYMENT? Or we should give him a facility to overwrite / Append the new back
payments?

Thanks a lot

hi Amin

Please find revised spec - sorry the original was confusing ( I had
forgotten that a mentioned a new screen for CREATE BACS FILE - which I meant
as later on in the spec to be part of the standard Print Cheque routine)

Hi Tony,

Please find attached original specs that I received from you about this
entry.  Could you please look at it and update it with the final process.
Please explain the process with the complete information especially the new

hi AMin

In reference to the points below:

1) Yes it is OK for these details to be entered on a separate screen

2) We do not need another screen to create the BACS payment file because of
3 below

3) Instead of having a new screen as above if we add  a new option on the
screen for printing cheques - "create BACS payment file ?" - then the
process of the cheque printing stays the same with all the updates including
the printing of a "CHEQUE/REMITTANCE ADVICE" - as this is the only way they
have of alerting the Vendor of the coming payment.

I hope this is now clear.

Hi Tony,

Here is a scenario of this entry. Please read it and if you find anything
wrong please confirm:

- Do we need to update the Vendor master file to have the new fields or we
should have a separate file to have all those fields. I recommend to have a
separate file to have it especially if the vendor dealings with more than
one bank.
- New screen needs to be added to hold those new fields. The objective from
this screen is to determine which vendor needs automatic payments to the
bank.  This screen will hold one record for each supplier + Bank.  The
layout of this screen as follows:

       Supplier Code:
       Sort Code:
       Account Code :
       Payee Name :
       Bank Code:
        <<   Ok   >>     << Cancel>>

- Another new screen will be added to create back payments file. This screen
will create an entry to ASCI file without printing any cheques or remittance
advice. The layout of this screen as follows:
       Supplier Code:
        Bank Code:
        <<   Ok   >>     << Cancel>>

- One more option will be added in Print Cheque report grid "CREATE BACS
PAYMENT FILE", Really it's not clear to me what should I do with this option
in Printing Cheque report. Please explain.


Note:  I attached the original specs that I have received from you about
this issue just in case you want to review it.


Thanks a lot.

hi Amin

re the simple ones:

Point 1 - yes the approve payments will be done in the standard way

Point 2 - the new screen is just an information screen where the client can
enter these extra details for each Vendor that will be paid by this method -
no payment processing will be done here.

Point 3 - The new "Create BACS PAYMENTS" - could be a new program or an
option on the report grid of the standard AP-Ouput-Print Cheque program. The
program  still needs to print a cheque/remittance advice -  which are sent
to the Vendor to alert them that a payment has been made. The only
difference will be if this option is selected it will create a entry to the
BACS ASCII file for each supplier that has an entry in the new screen as per
point 2.


I hope that this clarifies the issues

regds

Hi Tony!

Thanks for your explanation, now the idea is clear, but I'm still having
some questions about the implementing this issue.  I will explain to you
what I have understood and please confirm it:
1. After we have created the AP invoice for each supplier, we will approve
the payments as usually from the standard screen.
2. We will have a new screen that will pick up all the approved payments per
supplier. This screen will have the following fields ( supplier code, sort
code, account code, payee name, bank code and Ok button).   Once the user
clicks Ok button for the selected supplier, the program will do the same
process of the printing cheques but it will hold the data into an ASCII
file.

So far the process is clear but in the specs you have mentioned that you
have to add one more option to "Create Bas File", Really I don't know what
should I do with this option and what is the difference with the above point
# 2.  I have attached the original specs that I have received from you just
to review the pages #  3 and 4.

It will good for me if you attach your explaining with an example starting
from beginning until the updating the ASCII File.


Waiting for your help

Thanks a lot

hi

I will try to explain as simply as possible:

We have a facility in the UK called "Bank Automated Credit Transfers" hence
the the phrase BACS payments. This is where a customer's bank auotmatically
transfers payment to a vendor based on information sent to the bank by the
customer.

e.g. If I was a customer paying Aria (the vendor) - i would instruct the
bank to pay Aria a certain sum of money that would be autoamtically
transferred from my bank to Aria's bank.

There is a facility at the moment provided by the Banks whereby you can key
the amounts to be paid into a piece of software supplied by the banks which
auotmatically sends a file to the bank to let them know which vendors to pay
and how much. The client wants to be able to create this file in Aria to
save having to do the job twice.

The specification I sent you was suppossed to explain this and how it should
work.

If the spec still does not make sense please let me know which aspects
require more clarification I will do it for you.

Hi Tony,

Regarding the BACS payment   program ,  I'm  really confused,  I had read
this specs so many times to just put my hand on the process of this entry
but each time I got a different idea.
Could you please send me in detail what you need exactly with this entry so
that I can understand  what actually required so that I can estimate how
many days required to finish this entry.
Thanks  a lot
