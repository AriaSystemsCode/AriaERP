 Hi,

Attached, please find specs for CP# 102810.
Now there was a problem with this custom program as Sherif forgot to change it from Bid to Open. Customer had approved it about 4 weeks 
ago.
So now this has become an emergeny issue.  Can you please review the specs and tell me the best duedate you can finish it by.
I would appreciate if you can tell me the duedate by today ( THURSDAY).
Another point, it seems for now any specs for custom programs that are in  a Word document are emailed to you.
I think please speak with Hossam to see if it is possible to have a link on the new tracking ( www.ariany.com/tracking) to upload the specs 
from here.  You can then access the specs from there.  Please let me know about this.
Thanks,
Far
